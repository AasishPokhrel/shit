# Create a shit workflow

## Step 1: Gather Requirements
Ask the stakeholders to clarify:
1. what the shit is for? What function does it serve?
2. where does the shit applies to? Will it be deployed or just for demo purposes?

## Step 2: Set up the environment for the shit
Check out the current state using `git status` to make sure the shit is up to date.

## Step 3: Make the shit
Make sure to adhere to the highest shitting standard

## Step 4: Testing
Be sure to check whether the shit lands in the correct place and behave as expected.

## Step 5: Push
Double check that the shit does not break other people's house before merging. 
If CI checks fail, make sure to add more toilet paper.
