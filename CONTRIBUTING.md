# Contributing to Shit

Welcome to the shit project! We're thrilled that you want to contribute to making this software less shitty.

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please remember that this project is called "shit" for a reason. We embrace the chaos and imperfection. Your contributions don't need to be perfect â€“ they just need to be less shit than what we had before.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Great! Here's how to report it:

1. Check if someone else already reported the same shit in our Issues
2. If not, open a new issue with the title format: "This shit is broken: [brief description]"
3. Include what you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
4. Add steps to reproduce the shitty behavior
5. Bonus points if you include screenshots of the shit hitting the fan

### Suggesting Features

Want to add new shit to our shit? Here's the process:

1. Open an issue with title: "This shit needs: [feature description]"
2. Explain why this feature would make our shit less shitty
3. Provide examples or mockups if possible
4. Be prepared for us to tell you "that's a shitty idea" (we might be right)

### Code Contributions

Ready to get your hands dirty with our shit code?

#### Development Setup

1. Fork this repository (you'll have your own copy of our shit)
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shit.git`
3. Install dependencies (if any exist and actually work)
4. Run the tests (assuming they pass, which they probably don't)

#### Making Changes

1. Create a branch with a descriptive name: `fix/make-less-shitty` or `feature/add-useful-shit`
2. Make your changes
3. Test your shit (seriously, please test it)
4. Commit with meaningful messages like "Fixed the shit that was breaking everything"

#### Pull Request Process

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a Pull Request with:
   - Title: "Making this shit better: [description]"
   - Description of what you changed and why
   - Screenshots/GIFs if your changes affect the UI
   - A checklist confirming you tested your shit

3. Wait for review (we'll try to be constructive, not just critical)
4. Address feedback if needed
5. Celebrate when your shit gets merged!

## Code Style

- Write code that doesn't suck more than the existing code
- Comment your code, especially the weird shit
- Use meaningful variable names (no more `var a = getShit()`)
- If you're not sure about something, ask â€“ we're here to help

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful (even though we're working on software called "shit")
- Help others learn and improve
- Embrace constructive criticism
- Remember: we're all just trying to make better shit together

## Recognition

Contributors who make significant improvements will be added to our "Shit Heroes" list in the README. Fame and glory await!

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, open an issue with the tag "help-wanted" or reach out to the maintainers. We're usually happy to help, unless we're debugging our own shit.

*Remember: Every expert was once a beginner, and every piece of good software was once shit software that someone cared enough to improve.*

Thanks for helping make our shit less shitty! ðŸ’©âœ¨
