# 💩 Contributing to S.H.I.T. (Super Hyper Interactive Turd)

Welcome to the most important open source project of our time. You've chosen to contribute to digital excrement, and we salute your questionable life choices.

## 🚽 Before You Contribute

Ask yourself:
- Do I really want "Contributed to a shit visualization project" on my resume?
- Have I had enough coffee to deal with this crap?
- Am I prepared to explain this to my therapist?

If you answered yes to any of these, you're ready to dive into the pile!

## 🧻 Code of Conduct

1. **No Bullshit** - Only dogshit is allowed in this repository
2. **Keep it Classy** - Our shit should be artisanal, not amateur
3. **Flush After Use** - Always clean up your console.logs
4. **Wash Your Hands** - Run the linter before committing

## 💨 Getting Started

1. Fork this shit (literally)
2. Clone your forked shit
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/even-shittier-feature`
4. Make your changes (try not to break the shit that already works)
5. Test your shit thoroughly (we aim for 88% coverage, not 100% because nobody's perfect)
6. Commit your shit with meaningful messages

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

Good commit messages:
- `feat: add corn texture for enhanced realism`
- `fix: prevent shit from floating in mid-air`
- `style: make shit shinier`
- `perf: optimize shit rendering performance`

Bad commit messages:
- `fixed stuff`
- `asdfasdf`
- `i hate my life`
- `why am i doing this`

## 🎨 Code Style

- Use TypeScript (because even shit needs types)
- Follow the ESLint rules (they're not just suggestions, they're the law)
- Format with Prettier (because even poop should be pretty)
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary (we have standards)

## 🧪 Testing

Every piece of shit needs to be tested:
```bash
npm test          # Run tests
npm run test:coverage  # Check coverage (aim for the stars, settle for 88%)
```

If your tests are failing, remember: it's not a bug, it's a feature... unless it actually is a bug.

## 🚀 Pull Request Process

1. **Title your PR appropriately**: "Add realistic steam effects" not "made changes"
2. **Describe what you've done**: We need to know what fresh hell you've created
3. **Include screenshots**: A picture is worth a thousand turds
4. **Wait for review**: Our maintainers will get to your PR when they're done questioning their life choices
5. **Address feedback**: Yes, even shit code gets code reviews

### PR Checklist:
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines (Prettier didn't cry)
- [ ] I've tested this locally (it works on my machine™)
- [ ] I've added tests for new features (88% or bust)
- [ ] I've updated the documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] I've checked that my changes don't break existing shit
- [ ] I've questioned my sanity at least once during this process

## 🎯 What We're Looking For

### Good First Issues:
- Adding new texture variations
- Improving the physics (gravity is important)
- Adding weather effects (rain makes everything worse)
- Sound effects (use your imagination... or don't)

### Advanced Contributions:
- VR support (for the full immersive experience)
- Multiplayer mode (competitive pooping?)
- Achievement system ("Collected 100 Virtual Turds!")
- NFT integration (just kidding, please don't)

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Of course you did, it's a shit project. Here's how to report it:

1. Check if someone else already reported this shit
2. Create a new issue with the template
3. Include:
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened (probably something shitty)
   - Steps to reproduce the bug
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Your therapist's contact info (for us)

## 💡 Feature Requests

Have an idea to make this project even shittier? We want to hear it!

Just remember:
- Keep it SFW (Safe For Work... somehow)
- No actual bathroom humor (we're classier than that)
- Must enhance the artistic vision
- Bonus points if it makes people question humanity

## 🏆 Recognition

Contributors will be immortalized in our Hall of Shame (coming soon). Your mother will be so proud.

## 📜 License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as this project. You also agree that you've made some questionable decisions in life, and this is just another one to add to the pile.

## 🙏 Final Words

Thank you for contributing to this monument of human achievement. May your code be bug-free and your sense of humor intact.

Remember: We're not just making shit, we're making **art**.
