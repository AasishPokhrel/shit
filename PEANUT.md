# To Eat a Peanut

To eat or not to eat? That is the question.

# It's not a hard question.

The Answer is Yes.

# But how will the peanut feel?

Perry the Peanut stared into the yawning abyss before him. The massive, pudgy fingers that clutched him in its grasp held him teeter-tottering at its rim.

Had he come all this way, from the foundling fields of his legumic youth, only to meet his end here? He could barcely recall home anymore. He could scarcely remember his brothers and sisters of the soil, lost in the current of a sea of peanuts that trundled through industrial chutes and iron drum vats. He'd beheld the horrors of the Machine that had stolen him from his home (which was but another machination of mass-slavery of the Machine) and packaged him into vacuum-tight plastic bags. He had crisscrossed the world on trucks, ships and planes, before finally reaching his end on foreign soil, held by foreign fingers, before a foreign cavern wider than his very comprehension.

He stared into the abyss, and the abyss stared back. He could see pearly white teeth (teeth!), glistening with spittle and crawling with multitudes of squirming, worming bacteria. He could see a slithering, quivering tongue, pink and full of pustules, twisting and lying in wait for poor souls to constrict. He could see saliva pooling in crevices and orifices, squirting out of alien tubes, in mechanical preparation to drown him. And he could see a tunnel - a deep, deep, deep tunnel that went down and down into the depths of the earth, deeper than the roots of his home had ever delved and darker than the nightmares of the factory.

It was Doom. This was his Doom.

The pudgy fingers released him. Cold air parted before him as he fell. Perry felt the air of freedom for the last time in his life.

The tongue was wet. He landed upon it as massive jaws snapped shut, snipping off the last light he would ever see. The tongue twitched and immediately it curled around him, smothered him, tightened its grip. Massive jaws clo Saliva poured over him, a billion needles of molecules stabbing into his skin. But he was tough - he would not go without a fight.

But quickly the tongue let go and tossed him up. And then the teeth, those pearly whites, grabbed him. What were they doing to him? What were they _all_ doing to him? And it was only then that he realised that those jaws were pressing down on him. The teeth were squeezing him.

The strain began to get to him. Acid burned down Perry's face. The teeth squeezed and squeezed and squeezed. He could feel it - his insides slipping, cracking, breaking him open -

CRACK!!

Perry fell back onto the tongue. Perry fell into the seams of the lips. Perry clung to the teeth's crowns. Perry was everywhere and nowhere. He was in pieces.

But the teeth were not done. Crack! Crack! Crack! they went, crushing him into tinier and tinier pieces. Now he was dissolving into the saliva, joining the liquid acid and mixing into a molten mush. The pain was immeasurable - quite literally.

And finally the tongue gathered all of him up, and gently rolled him into a ball. What sordid, useless endeavour this was, to slice him into a billion pieces before putting him back together as a monstrous amalgam. The tongue gave a push, and he tumbled into the tunnel.

Down and down he went. He could feel nothing and everything. He was no more, and yet his journey was only beginning. Where would he go now, and what would he become?
