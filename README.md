# 💩 S.H.I.T. - Super Hyper Interactive Turd

> "Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. But here we are." - Every developer on this project

A groundbreaking 3D visualization that answers the age-old question: "What if we used cutting-edge web technologies to render poop?" This masterpiece pushes the boundaries of what's socially acceptable in software engineering.

## 🚽 Why This Exists

In a world full of productivity apps, social networks, and life-changing software, we asked ourselves: "What does humanity really need?" The answer was obvious. A meticulously crafted, scientifically accurate, high-performance turd simulator.

## 🌟 Features That'll Make You Flush With Pride

- **🎨 Artisanal Craftsmanship**: Each pile is procedurally generated with love, care, and questionable life choices
- **🌪️ Realistic Physics**: Watch in awe as our creation obeys the laws of gravity (because even virtual poop can't escape physics)
- **🎮 Interactive Controls**: Rotate, zoom, and contemplate your life decisions in full 3D
- **🌈 Dynamic Lighting**: Because if you're going to render excrement, it might as well be beautifully lit
- **🧪 Scientifically Accurate**: Based on extensive research we definitely didn't make up
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Looks like shit on every device! (That's the point)
- **♿ Accessible**: Everyone deserves equal access to digital dung

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Tools of Our Shame)

- **React 19.1** - Because even poop needs a modern framework
- **Three.js 0.177** - Making shit look good since 2010
- **TypeScript 5.8** - Type-safe turds
- **Vite 6.3** - Building shit faster than ever
- **Vitest** - Testing our crap so you don't have to
- **ESLint & Prettier** - Even poop code should be clean

## 📦 Installation (At Your Own Risk)

1. Question your life choices:
```bash
echo "What am I doing with my life?"
```

2. Clone this monument to human achievement:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/champi-dev/shit.git
cd shit
```

3. Install dependencies (and lose a bit of your soul):
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open `http://localhost:5173` and witness glory

## 🧪 Testing (Because Quality Matters)

We maintain 88% test coverage because perfection is overrated:

```bash
npm test                 # Run tests
npm run test:coverage    # See how well we've tested this crap
```

### Why not 100% coverage?
Because some things in life shouldn't be tested. Also, testing WebGL in Node.js is harder than explaining this project to your parents.

## 🚀 Deployment (Share Your Shame)

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

When Vercel asks "What's your project about?", just say "3D visualization" and change the subject.

### Deploy Anywhere Else

```bash
npm run build
```

Then upload the `dist` folder to any static host that's willing to accept it.

## 🎨 Technical Details (For the Nerds)

### The Sacred Geometry

Our proprietary P.O.O.P. algorithm (Procedurally Optimized Organic Piles) generates:

- **2.5 Spiral Rotations**: The golden ratio of turd topology
- **Variable Radius**: From 0.3 units (thicc) to 0.1 units (tapered perfection)
- **Organic Wobbles**: Because nature isn't perfect, and neither is our code
- **Realistic Bulges**: Stop giggling, this is science

### Material Science

- **Primary Palette**: #5D4037 (Mahogany Mistake)
- **Shadow Tones**: #3E2723 (Regretful Brown)
- **Highlight Variations**: #6D4C41 (Questioning Umber)
- **Surface Properties**:
  - Roughness: 0.6 (Like sandpaper, but worse)
  - Metalness: 0.05 (Slightly shiny, deeply disturbing)
  - Clearcoat: 0.3 (That fresh, wet look nobody asked for)

### Performance Optimizations

Because if you're going to render poop, render it at 60 FPS:

- Geometry cached with `useMemo` (remember the shit, don't rebuild it)
- Efficient vertex generation (every vertex counts)
- Shadow mapping (even poop casts shadows)
- Proper Three.js disposal (clean up after yourself)

## ⚖️ Code of Conduct

1. Be respectful (even though we're making poop jokes)
2. No actual toilet humor (we have standards... low ones, but still)
3. Test your shit (literally)
4. Document your crap
