<h2>What is ðŸ’©ï¼Ÿ</h2>
<pre class="sp">Shit, commonly known as "fecal", "dung", "poop", etc.,
  is the excretion of the large intestine of people or animals.
  The term is called excretion, which means to eliminate food residues.
  Three-quarters of the shit are water, and the remaining quarter is solid.
  Most of the solid substances are proteins, inorganic substances, fat, undigested dietary fiber, dehydrated digestive fluid residues,
  and cells and dead bacteria shed from the intestines, as well as vitamin K and vitamin B.
  For farmers, shit can be used as organic fertilizer for good crops.</pre>
